# TASK MANAGER

I've created this task manager with Ruby on Rails. It helps you to organize your work in different projects. Within your projects, you can create tasks with a great WYSIWYG HTML editor. Once a task is complete, you can mark it as done and see the state of completion of your tasks.

## ⚙️ Stack
- Ruby/Ruby on Rails
- Turbolinks gem (with the task complete checkbox)
- [TinyMCE WYSIWYG HTML editor](https://www.tiny.cloud "TinyMCE WYSIWYG")

- Heroku

## 🖥 Features
